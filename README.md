# abstractit/puppet-base

Base docker image of CentOS 7 with EPEL and Puppetlabs repos and puppet,facter and hiera installed.
Versions are based on env vars.

# Usage

This image doesn't do much by itself it's just a base container for my other projects. Feel free to use it for your own projects.
I will be updating it occasionally as updates to base CentOS are needed
